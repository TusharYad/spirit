      <p>
        Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.[1] It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since 1964.

The complete rules are extensive, but simply, play proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court. The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. The team may touch the ball up to 3 times but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively. Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack, an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court.

      <h1 class="eventh text-center text-center "><u>Rules</u></h1>

       </p>

       <p>
         The following points system will be followed for the matches played
 on league basis.
 Results Winners Losers
 3-0 3 pts 0 pts
 3-1 3 pts 0 pts
 3-2 2 pts 1 pts
 Technical forfeit: 1 point
       </p>

       <p>

 eliminated from the competition and the results of the matches already
 played will be cancelled.
       </p>

       <p>
         In case of teams having equal points the following equation will
 determine the ranking.
 EXAMPLE: C = A/B
 A Team B Team
 A-Total number of sets won 11 9
 B-Total number of sets lost 4 3
 C-Ratio of set “B” team is 11/4=2.75 9/3 = 3.0 having highest ratio
 3.0 The team with higher ratio “C” will be ranked higher. If the tie still
 remains, then the following system will be applied.
 A Team B Team
 A-Total number of winning points 120 90
 B-Total number of lost points 90 125
 Z = A/B 120/90=1.33 90/125=0.72

 The team with higher ratio “Z” will be ranked higher. If the tie
 still remains then the following procedure will be adopted. Two
 teams involved: precedence will be given to the team winning that
 match, in which they played against each other. In no circumstances
 extra match will be played to determine which team ranked higher.
       </p>

       <p>
         The tally of all matches played in the league fixture will be considered.
 The general rules for Volleyball (Women) are the same. The game will
 be best of three sets.
